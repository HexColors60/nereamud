NereaMud

NereaMud is born from the will to have an old style game that keeps your mind busy like a book better than a movie.
The choice went to a MUD game. Multi-User Dungeon. A game where people connect to the same server and can interact verbally. 
A world that grows with you; people can contribute and create new rooms, new areas.

This game model doesn't need a subscription nor crazy hardware for it to be enjoyed. Just some fantasy and creativity.

The choice was hard to make but finally decided to go with NakedMud. The author, Geoff Hollis, based it on SocketMud (Brian Graversen),
since he wanted to have a basic game server to extend at his will. 

I chose NakedMud because it has all the basics of a mud game server, without the constraints of a fully finished mud codebase.
Easy to extend with all the features that were added by Geoff Hollis, like Python and modules.

Please see in the doc folder for the original README. 

Stay tuned...
